              Tsunami is the second-oldest of her adoptive siblings, and was raised in a cave underground. She was one of five dragonets prophesied to end a twenty-year war, and, as such, knew no more than seven dragons for a good majority of her early life.

              <h4><u>Post-Escape</u></h4>
              Tsunami, along with her adoptive sibling Clay, managed to escape their underground cave, freeing their other siblings in turn. They were then immediately captured by the SkyWing queen and taken prisoner. Eventually, the five siblings ended up escaping this prison, too. Tsunami and her siblings then traveled the continent, meeting other dragons and having a grand adventure.
